Some scripts to scrap baby names from different sites

Started with scrappy to scrap names from sites, but it was probably overkill. Went back to simple python and BeautifulSoup and 1 script/site was sufficient.

Currently these scripts scrap for boy name, change it accordingly if you want it for girl.
